# ALL‑IN‑ONE — Live Factory Operations Model (CCMF)

**Goal:** Turn ALL‑IN‑ONE into a continuously running, community‑powered, profit‑centric “live factory.”

## 1) Strategy Board
- **Domains:** foundral.tech, all‑in‑one.foundral.tech (HTTPS enforced)
- **Core Repos:** all‑in‑one, charlotte‑everley‑free, repobuilder‑gpt, n8n forks…
- **Revenue Streams:** SaaS, GPT Store, consulting, templates
- **Community:** Issues, PRs, Discussions, weekly demos (TGIF)

## 2) Weekly Release Cadence
- **Mon**: Plan weekly goals
- **Wed**: Mid‑week review (PRs)
- **Fri**: **TGIF release** → tag + CHANGELOG + Pages deploy
- **Weekend**: Community merges + weekly report

## 3) Contribution Workflow
- `main` locked (branch protection)
- Fork → feature branch → PR → Review → Merge
- Required: passing checks + updated docs (README/CHANGELOG)

## 4) Quality & Measurement (ISO/CMMI/Six Sigma Inspired)
- **Define:** Each repo has outcome metrics in README
- **Measure:** commits/week, closed issues, uptime, traffic
- **Analyze:** top content/features driving value
- **Improve:** retrospective per quarter
- **Control:** pre‑merge checks, style guides, templates

## 5) Release Ritual (TGIF)
- Tag format: `tgif-YYYYMMDD` + semantic tag (vX.Y.Z as needed)
- Public note on site + Release entry on GitHub
- Short demo (GIF/video) optional
