## Suggested Branch Protection (Settings → Branches → main)
- Require a pull request before merging (min 1 approval)
- Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
- Require status checks to pass before merging (Actions must succeed)
- Require linear history
- Restrict who can push to matching branches (no direct pushes to `main`)
- Require signed commits (optional)
- Require conversation resolution before merging
