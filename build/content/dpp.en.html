<p>What if every product you bought carried a <strong>digital identity</strong> that revealed its origin, materials, carbon footprint, and recycling instructions? This isn’t science fiction—it’s launching in Europe by 2026 and may transform global shopping habits.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-digital-product-passport">What is a Digital Product Passport?</h2>
<p>The <strong>Digital Product Passport (DPP)</strong> is a digital record following a product through its life cycle—from raw material extraction to manufacturing, transport, use, and recycling. It’s a birth certificate, user manual, and sustainability report in one.</p>
<h2 id="why-now">Why Now?</h2>
<p>The EU’s Green Deal mandates DPP for sectors like textiles, electronics, and batteries starting in 2026. Transparency demand, blockchain for anti-counterfeit, and the growth of the resale economy are accelerating this shift.</p>
