This guide helps contributors and readers navigate **deployment history**, **release notes**, and our **branching/tagging strategy** in the ALL-IN-ONE project.

## 1. Checking Deployments
- Visit: [GitHub → Deployments](https://github.com/cevherdogan/all-in-one/deployments)
- Each deployment entry shows:
  - **Environment** (e.g., `github-pages`)
  - **Commit hash**
  - **Deployed by**
  - **Timestamp**
- Use this to confirm when the latest content went live.

## 2. Reading Release Notes
- Release notes summarize what changed in a given tagged version.
- Future releases will include:
  - **New articles/guides**
  - **Template updates**
  - **Automation improvements**
- Access: GitHub → **Releases** tab.

## 3. CHANGELOG.md
- The `CHANGELOG.md` file lists changes in chronological order.
- Format:
  ```
  ## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
  ### Added
  - New content or feature

  ### Changed
  - Updates to existing pages

  ### Fixed
  - Bug fixes or corrections
  ```
- Contributors should update it for every meaningful change.

## 4. Tagging Strategy
- Semantic versioning: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
  - **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
  - **MINOR**: New content/features
  - **PATCH**: Fixes or minor updates
- Example:
  - `v1.0.0` — initial public release
  - `v1.1.0` — added 3 new guides
  - `v1.1.1` — fixed typos and links

## 5. Branching Strategy
- `main` is **locked** — direct pushes are disabled.
- All changes come through **Pull Requests** from forks.
- Suggested branch naming:
  - `feature/<short-description>` — new content or functionality
  - `fix/<short-description>` — bug or typo fixes
  - `docs/<short-description>` — documentation-only changes
- PRs must:
  - Pass automated checks
  - Be reviewed and approved

## 6. Why This Matters
- **Transparency**: Clear history of what was deployed and when.
- **Quality Control**: Peer review ensures accuracy and consistency.
- **Traceability**: Tags and changelog entries help track features across versions.

## Community Learning
Following this guide ensures everyone — maintainers, contributors, and readers — can easily:
- See what’s new
- Understand the workflow
- Join the project without guesswork
