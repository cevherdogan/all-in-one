What if every product you bought carried a **digital identity** that revealed its origin, materials, carbon footprint, and recycling instructions? This isn’t science fiction—it’s launching in Europe by 2026 and may transform global shopping habits.

## What is a Digital Product Passport?
The **Digital Product Passport (DPP)** is a digital record following a product through its life cycle—from raw material extraction to manufacturing, transport, use, and recycling. It’s a birth certificate, user manual, and sustainability report in one.

## Why Now?
The EU’s Green Deal mandates DPP for sectors like textiles, electronics, and batteries starting in 2026. Transparency demand, blockchain for anti-counterfeit, and the growth of the resale economy are accelerating this shift.

## Impact on Stakeholders
- **Manufacturers** must digitize and share product data.
- **Logistics providers** will integrate live tracking.
- **Retailers** can showcase sustainability credentials.
- **Consumers** gain instant, trusted info.

## Opportunities
- Software platforms for DPP data management  
- Blockchain-secured supply chains  
- IoT-enabled tracking  
- Compliance consulting  
- Sustainability analytics

## Conclusion
The Digital Product Passport is more than a regulation—it’s a revolution in transparency. Early adopters will lead; latecomers risk falling behind.
